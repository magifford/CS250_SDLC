1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    User needs are interpreted through the creation of user stories that come from meetings held with the customer.  In this project, I assumed the various roles of the scrum team and took the requirements set forth by the customer and explained the corresponding functionality of the program within the user stories.
    
2: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    Before writing a single line of code for a program, I like to lay out the functionality requirements that the program is intended to meet.  This allows me to plan the code out and begin with a good idea of how I want to achieve my goals for the program.  In my future development work, I would like to incorporate sprints and sprint planning since it is a good strategy to break up large projects.
    
3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    There are many aspects that one must have to be a good team member as it pertains to software development.  In my opinion, the most important ones are good communication and humility.  A good team member is able to communicate clearly and effectively with the rest of the team so as to ensure the success of the sprint and the project as a whole.  Furthermore, it is important for the team members to remember that they may not know everything and have the sense to step back and acknowledge that.  Everyone is human and we all make mistakes; therefore, a good team member accepts this and works to help others and accept help when needed.
